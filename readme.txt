FORGOT TO ADD A STEP: you need to install python for this, and after that, run requirments.py

Step 1 is to create a qr code for each client/student using qr_maker.py
Step 2 is to open student-verific.py on any text editor of your choice
Step 3 is to fill out the list 'students' with the names of all the students/clients (i will make this simpler in an later update)

Now you should be ready to do your stuff!

Disclaimer! I am not held accountable for any issues which is not related to the code itself (like errors on your side or anything else related on the client side) and this program was just made for fun! dont use it in a real world solution as this might be really buggy
